Smart Plant Guardian is a fully automated environmental monitoring system designed to track the real-time health conditions of a Peace Lily plant. Using an Arduino Nicla Sense ME (or MKR WiFi) and a Python analytics pipeline, the system continuously records temperature, humidity, VOCs, and pressure, stores the data using FAIR principles, and visualises it on an interactive Plotly Dash dashboard with a real-time health score. The project demonstrates high-quality data engineering: clean acquisition, structured storage, metadata inclusion, robust monitoring, and clear scientific visualisation.

“How do environmental fluctuations inside a typical apartment (temperature, humidity, VOC levels, pressure) influence the health and stress response of a Peace Lily over 24 hours?”

•	Location: At home (apartment living room, south-facing window)
•	Motivation: Indoor plants are strongly affected by cooking, heating, ventilation, and diurnal temperature cycles.
