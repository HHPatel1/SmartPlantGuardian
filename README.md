Smart Plant Guardian 🌿
A fully automated, data-driven environmental monitoring system for Peace Lily health assessment.

Project Overview
Smart Plant Guardian is an end-to-end environmental sensing and analytics system designed to measure and interpret the real-time health conditions of a Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum) in a typical apartment environment. Using an Arduino Nicla Sense ME (or MKR WiFi), the system continuously records:

Temperature,
Humidity,
VOC concentration and 
Atmospheric pressure


Data is streamed via MQTT or serial, stored following FAIR data principles, processed using Python, and visualised on an interactive Plotly Dash dashboard with a continuously updated plant Health Score.

Research Question:
How do environmental fluctuations inside a typical apartment (temperature, humidity, VOC levels, pressure) influence the health and stress response of a Peace Lily over 24 hours?
